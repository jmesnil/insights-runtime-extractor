# Integration with Insights Operator

## Status

In Progress

## Context

We need to find the right location to collect runtime information on OpenShift and feed them back to Red Hat.

## Decision

https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator[Insights Operator] has been identified at the place to integrate the container scanner.
It already has in place a data modeld and a workflow to "gather" cluster information and report them back to Red Hat.

## Consequences

An https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1584[enhancement] has been proposed to integrate the container scanner in the OpenShift Insights Operator.
