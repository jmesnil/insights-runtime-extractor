# OpenShift Insights Runtime Extractor
:toc:

This repository provides a mechanism to gather runtime info from containers to get additional insights on user workloads and make investment decisions that will drive utilization.

The container images built from this repository provides an `insights-runtime-extractor`
feature integrated to the https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/tree/master[OpenShift Insights Operator].

This feature was proposed and approved by https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/insights/insights-runtime-extractor.md[this enhancement].

The container image is published at `ghcr.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`

The container images built from this project provides an `insights-runtime-extractor`
feature integrated to the https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/tree/master[OpenShift Insights Operator].

The request for enhancement for this feature was created at https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/1584.

The container images are built by a GitHub action and published to:

* `ghcr.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`
* `ghcr.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-exporter:latest`

## Build the container images

[source,bash]
----
make build-image
----

It builds 2 multi-arch (ARM64 & AMD64) images:

* `quay.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`
* `quay.io/jmesnil/insights-runtime-exporter:latest`

To build the images in another container registry, you can use the `IMAGE_REGISTRY` env var:

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-user-name make build-image
----

## Build the development image for Rust

[source,bash]
----
make build-rust-dev-image
----

This creates a `rust-dev` Container image that contains all the Rust plumbing to compile and execute the code in `extractor`

### Run the development image and compile the Rust code base

[source,bash]
----
make rust-dev

# you are then inside a container ready to compile the Rust code
make
----

## Test the container images

Prequesites:

* To test the container images, you must have access to an OpenShift cluster and
be logged in with a cluster admin account.

To run the end-to-end (e2e) tests, run the command:

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/jmesnil make e2e-test
----
